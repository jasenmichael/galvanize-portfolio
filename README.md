# galvanize-portfolio



I just finished taking the "Get Prepared for the Web Development Immersive - Javascript Accelerated" course at [Galvanize Platte](https://www.galvanize.com/denver-platte/campus "Galvanize Platte 1644 Platte St. Denver, Co. 80202") in Denver Colorado.





I have been a carpenter and contractor for most of my adult years. I do IT work on the side. Computers and electronics, and software has mostly been a hobby.

Some intermediate knowledge I have is:
-linux/unix  terminal & bash scripting
-Apache web server
-php
-MySQL
-Wordpress
-Drupal
-Html, CSS
-networking


I host several websites of which I hope to vastly improve during the immersive.

http://ready-builder.com/
http://marsalom.com/
http://greenbriarschool.org/
http://annefeeney.com
http://livingstoncoffee.com/
http://www.tech512.com/

Over the last 10 years I have really dove into things more, but I have learned many bad practices. My short time spent at Galvanize has inspired me. Galvanize is a tool for networking and collaboration.
