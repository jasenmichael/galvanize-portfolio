## galvanize-portfolio

I just finished taking the "Get Prepared for the Web Development Immersive - Javascript Accelerated" course at [Galvanize Platte](https://www.galvanize.com/denver-platte/campus "Galvanize Platte 1644 Platte St. Denver, Co. 80202") in Denver Colorado.

This is a project I put together as a part of my portfolio for the Galvanize application process.
